# Blockchain application for Requirement Traceability

## Setup the application
1. Download the blockchain_app directory...
2. Create and activate the virtual environment in the blockchain_app directory:
  - Windows
```
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
  - macOS
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install all the dependencies in the virtual environment
```
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```
4. Run the local node and web app:
```
python run.py
```
5. Your app is up and running, copy the address and paste it onto any web browser. This will direct you to homepage of the web application.

## Ngrok (optional)
1. To broadcast the app running in the local network, you can use ngrok. Register and follow the instructions to download the ngrok. For instance, your app is running on local network https://localhost:5000, the below command can be used in the ngrok terminal that allows local network accessible to everyone..
```
ngrok http 5000
